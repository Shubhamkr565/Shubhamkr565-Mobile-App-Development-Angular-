            Introduction to AnguarJs


    AngularJS is a very powerful JavaScript Framework.
    It is a library written in JavaScript.
    It help us to create a reactive SPA.
    AnguarJs is open source, completely free, and used by more than 10lack of developers around the world.
    
        Features of Angularjs
    
    Components - The earlier version of Angular had a focus of Controllers but now has changed the focus to having components over controllers. Components help to build the applications into many modules. This helps in better maintaining the application over a period of time.
    
    Typescript − The newer version of Angular is based on Typescript. This is a superset of JavaScript and is maintained by Microsoft.
    Services − Services are a set of code that can be shared by different components of an application. So for example if you had a data component that picked data from a database, you could have it as a shared service that could be used across multiple applications.
    Better event-handling capabilities, powerful templates, and better support for mobile devices.
    
        Components of Angular
    
    Modules − This is used to break up the application into logical pieces of code. Each piece of code or module is designed to perform a single task.
    
    Component − This can be used to bring the modules together.
    
    Templates − This is used to define the views of an Angular JS application.
    
    Metadata − This can be used to add more data to an Angular JS class.
    
    Service − This is used to create components which can be shared across the entire application.
    
        Angular 2 Environment

    Npm − Node package manager that is used to work with the open source repositories. Angular JS as a framework has dependencies on other components. And npm can be used to download these dependencies and attach them to your project.
    
    Git − This is the source code software that can be used to get the sample project from the github angular site.
    Editor − There are many editors that can be used for Angular JS development such as Visual Studio code and WebStorm. In our tutorial, we will use Visual Studio code which comes free of cost from Microsoft.
    
            Angular  –CLI

    Angular CLI - Command Line Interface (CLI) can be used to create our Angular JS application. It also helps in creating a unit and end-to-end tests for the application.
