Creating and running an Ionic application on your PC involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide to get you started:

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Ionic requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website.

Step 2: Install Ionic CLI
Once Node.js and npm are installed, open your command line or terminal and install the Ionic CLI globally by running:

npm install -g @ionic/cli
Step 3: Create a New Ionic Project
After installing the Ionic CLI, you can create a new Ionic project. Use the following command:
ionic start myApp blank
Here, myApp is the name of your project, and blank is the template you can replace with other templates like tabs or sidemenu.

Step 4: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Navigate to the directory of your newly created project:
cd myApp
Step 5: Serve the Application
To run your Ionic application on your PC (in a web browser), use the following command:

ionic serve
This command will build your application and start a local development server. You can view your application in a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8100.

Step 6: Make Changes and See Live Reload
As you develop your application, any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the application in the browser.

Step 7: Testing and Building for Different Platforms
If you want to test your Ionic application on different platforms (such as Android or iOS), you'll need to install additional dependencies and platforms.
